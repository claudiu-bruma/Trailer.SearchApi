# Trailer.SearchApi
Trailer Search api 
Simplest way to access the api is : https://localhost:5001/api/SearchTrailers?query=deadpool
the api uses Tmdb api for movie database( the one that was the easyiest to get an api key ) 
and youtube api for video service 
both api key need to be set in the appsettings.json in the api project in order to user it 
The project was created using .net core 2.2 and visual studio 2019 ( might have some issues when loading solution in vs 2017)
